Determining the location of the ModelSim executable...

Using: C:\intelFPGA_lite\18.1\modelsim_ase\win32aloem

To specify a ModelSim executable directory, select: Tools -> Options -> EDA Tool Options
Note: if both ModelSim-Altera and ModelSim executables are available, ModelSim-Altera will be used.
